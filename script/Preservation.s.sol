        // - In the new timeLib contract, we will make `setTime(uint256)` function change the 2nd slot value in the storage.
        // - 2. We will recall `Preservation::setFirstTime`, and now it will change the 2nd storage slot value instead of the first one. Remember we changed the Lib contract address.
        // - We will be the owner of the `Preservation` contract, and we will pass the challenge.
